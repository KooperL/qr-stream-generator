# QR Scanner & Generator Suite

**Encode and decode files using QR code video streams ‚Äî all in your browser.**

---

## Project Overview

**QR Scanner & Generator Suite** is an open-source web project that demonstrates how to encode any file into a sequence of QR codes, generate a video from those codes, and later reconstruct the original file by scanning the QR codes from the video. This project showcases advanced browser-based file processing, QR encoding/decoding, and video manipulation ‚Äî all **without any server-side processing**.

## Key Features

- **File to QR Video Generator:**  
  Upload any file and convert it into a video of QR codes, with adjustable error correction and frame rate.

- **QR Video Scanner:**  
  Upload a QR code video to reconstruct and download the original file, using robust frame-by-frame QR decoding.

- **Privacy-first & Undetectable:**  
  <span style="color:#1976d2;font-weight:bold;">All processing happens locally in your browser.</span>  
  No files are uploaded or sent anywhere. This makes the process virtually undetectable by network monitoring tools.

- **Performance:**  
  Typical speed is **2 seconds per 500 bytes** of file data  
  (e.g., a 1KB file takes about 4 seconds to encode or decode).

- **Open & Extensible:**  
  Built with modern JavaScript, open libraries, and modular code for easy customization.
